1. To pull the Hadoop docker image:
docker pull bde2020/hadoop-namenode:latest

2. To list the docker images to confirm the Hadoop image is downloaded:
docker images

3. To run the Hadoop docker image:
docker run bde2020/hadoop-namenode:latest

4. To run a Docker container for a Hadoop NameNode instance:
docker run -it --name hadoop-cluster202 -p 9872:9871 -p 8090:8089 -p 60070:50070 bde2020/hadoop-namenode:latest /bin/bash

5. To start the Hadoop services once inside the container's shell at once:
start-all.sh

// If above code produces an error as "ERROR: namenoode is not COMMAND nor fully qualified CLASSNAME" continue from code 06

6. To initialize and format the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) NameNode:
hdfs namenode -format 

7. To start the HDFS NameNode in the background:
hdfs namenode &

8. To start the HDFS DataNode in the background:
hdfs datanode &

9. To start the YARN NodeManager process in the background:
yarn nodemanager &

10. To start the YARN ResourceManager process in the background:
yarn resourcemanager &

11. To create an input directory and upload sample files to HDFS:
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hadoop/input
hdfs dfs -put $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/*.xml /user/hadoop/input

12. To run the word count job:
hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-*.jar wordcount /user/hadoop/input /user/hadoop/output

13. To display the results of the word count job:
hdfs dfs -cat /user/hadoop/output/part-r-00000
